# KPMG-DataQualityAssessment
1. Compose an email to the client addressing the data quality issues identified and suggest strategies to mitigate these problems. Refer to the 'Data Quality Framework Table' and relevant resources to consider the criteria and dimensions.

2. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is a valued client of KPMG, specializing in high-quality bicycles and cycling accessories. Their marketing team aims to enhance business growth by analyzing their existing customer dataset to understand customer behavior and trends. Using the provided datasets (Customer demographic, customer address, and transactions), recommend which of the 1000 new customers should be targeted to maximize organizational value.

To present our recommendation, we will create a PowerPoint presentation outlining our approach. The client has agreed to a 3-week project scope consisting of three phases: Data Exploration, Model Development, and Interpretation.

We will develop a comprehensive plan that outlines the activities involved in completing the analysis. This plan includes tasks such as understanding data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modeling, interpreting results, and reporting. We will present this detailed plan to the client to obtain their sign-off. Please advise on the steps you would like us to take.

The PowerPoint presentation should provide a detailed approach for each of the three phases, including activities related to understanding data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modeling, interpreting results, and reporting. We will ensure this plan is presented to the client for their approval.

3. We will create a dashboard that can be presented to the client during our next meeting. The dashboard will summarize the data and present the results of our analysis. We will design the dashboard with a maximum of three views or tabs, allowing for creativity in layout and presentation. As this is not a KPMG branded deliverable, we have attached the client logo for incorporation. It is important to consider the business context when presenting findings, including identifying trends in the data, determining the customer segment with the highest value, proposing marketing and growth strategies for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, and suggesting additional external datasets that can provide further insights into customer preferences and purchasing tendencies. The presentation should specify which customers from the new 1000 customer list Sprocket Central Pty Ltd's marketing team should target, as well as the broader market segment they should focus on reaching out to.
